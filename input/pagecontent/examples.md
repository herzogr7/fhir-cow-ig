This section includes examples of how the patterns described elsewhere in this IG could be applied to particular use-cases. These examples are non-binding, and are intended only to illustrate to spec authors the expected use of the concepts here. 

### Example Resource Instances
You can find examples on the [Artifacts page](./artifacts.html#example-example-instances). Please note that these example represent the bare minimum of information at a point in time of a workflow. The core intent of this Implementation Guide is to serve as the common foundation of other IGs, which will be created for more specific clinical and operational contexts (e.g. Lab Order and Results workflow, Radiology Imaging workflow).
